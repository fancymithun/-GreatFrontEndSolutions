1.What does a DOCTYPE do?

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) tag that specifies the version of HTML or XML that a web page is written in. The purpose of the <!DOCTYPE> declaration is to tell the web browser how to interpret and render the web page, based on the rules and specifications of the chosen document type.

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is placed at the very beginning of an HTML document, before the <html> tag. Here is an example of a complete <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
This declaration tells the web browser to render the web page according to the HTML5 specification. The declaration also triggers standards mode in modern web browsers, which follows the standard rules for HTML and CSS.

In addition to specifying the HTML version, the <!DOCTYPE> declaration can also include other attributes that define the document type, such as the DTD (Document Type Definition) or a public identifier. These attributes can be useful for specifying the rules and specifications for specific XML document types.

Including a complete and correct <!DOCTYPE> declaration at the beginning of your HTML documents is important for ensuring that your web pages are displayed consistently across different browsers and devices. This can help avoid layout and display issues, as well as ensure that your web pages comply with web standards and best practices.
