<strong>1.What is CSS selector specificity and how does it work?</strong>

CSS selector specificity is a measure of how specific a CSS selector is, and it determines which styles should be applied to an element when there are conflicting styles specified for the same element.

In CSS, selectors can have different levels of specificity, which are calculated based on the number and types of selectors used in the selector. Here is how selector specificity is calculated:

Inline styles have the highest specificity and always override other styles. An inline style is applied to an element using the style attribute.

ID selectors have a higher specificity than class selectors or element selectors. An ID selector is specified using the # character followed by the ID of the element.

Class selectors have a higher specificity than element selectors. A class selector is specified using the . character followed by the name of the class.

If two selectors have the same level of specificity, the one that appears later in the stylesheet takes precedence.

Here are some examples to illustrate how selector specificity works:

```
<!-- inline style -->
<div style="color: red;">This text is red.</div>

<!-- ID selector -->
<div id="myDiv">This text is black.</div>
<style>
#myDiv {
  color: black;
}
</style>

<!-- class selector -->
<div class="myClass">This text is blue.</div>
<style>
.myClass {
  color: blue;
}
</style>

<!-- element selector -->
<p>This text is green.</p>
<style>
p {
  color: green;
}
</style>

```

In this example, the inline style on the first div element takes precedence over the ID selector, which takes precedence over the class selector, which takes precedence over the element selector.

It's important to understand selector specificity when working with CSS, as it can help you avoid unintended style conflicts and make sure that your styles are applied consistently across your website or application. However, it's also important to use selector specificity judiciously and avoid over-specific selectors, as they can make your code harder to maintain and lead to style conflicts.
